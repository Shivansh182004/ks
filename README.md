# 🌾 Krishi Sakhi

Krishi Sakhi is a full-stack web application developed to support farmers through digital agricultural services. The platform aims to simplify access to essential farming information and assist farmers in making informed, data-driven decisions using a user-friendly web interface.

The project is structured with a clear separation between frontend and backend components, making it scalable, maintainable, and suitable for academic projects and real-world extensions.

## 📌 Project Overview

Krishi Sakhi provides multiple agriculture-related modules such as crop advisory, weather information, mandi prices, government schemes, and an AI-powered chatbot. Each module is designed as a separate web page, allowing easy navigation and modular development.
